# Auto Layout Calculator

This is a demo project for my portfolio that i created using the experience i got studying on an iOS development course.

This app is not holding any logic side to it. I made it alongside watching the lessons on Auto Layout Chapter of the course. Its main purpose is to implement the auto layout settings using stack views.
